# GHOST DETECTING AI


## Basic Details
### Team Name: CODE CORE


### Team Members
- Team Lead:ANJALI M - GEC THRISSUR
- Member 2: ARYA T - GEC THRISSUR

### Project Description
GHOST DETECTING AI is a unique entertainment app that uses your device's sensors to "detect" paranormal entities around you.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Every day, we walk through countless invisible spirits without ever acknowledging them.  
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
 Our Ai website uses a highly-advanced quantum fluctuation algorithm and  phone's magnetometer to pinpoint spectral presences.
